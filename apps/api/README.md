# Dream Central Storage API

FastAPI backend service for Dream Central Storage. This package exposes a foundational application skeleton including configuration management, database wiring, and a health-check endpoint.

## Local Development

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'

## Database Schema

### Publisher-Book Relationship

Books reference publishers via a required foreign key relationship:

```
publishers
├── id (PK)
├── name (unique, indexed)
├── display_name
├── description
├── logo_url
├── contact_email
├── status
├── created_at
└── updated_at

books
├── id (PK)
├── publisher_id (FK → publishers.id, required)
├── book_name
├── book_title
├── book_cover
├── activity_count
├── activity_details (JSONB)
├── total_size
├── language
├── category
├── status
├── created_at
└── updated_at
```

The relationship is defined in SQLAlchemy as:
```python
# In Book model
publisher_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("publishers.id"), nullable=False)
publisher_rel: Mapped["Publisher"] = relationship("Publisher", back_populates="books")

# Convenience property for accessing publisher name
@property
def publisher(self) -> str:
    return self.publisher_rel.name
```

## Storage Structure

Files are organized in MinIO with the following structure:

```
publishers/                          # Main bucket for publisher content
  {publisher-name}/
    books/
      {book-name}/
        config.json                  # Book configuration
        pages/                       # Book pages
        assets/                      # Book-specific assets
    images/                          # Publisher images
    documents/                       # Publisher documents

teachers/                            # Bucket for teacher-uploaded content
  {teacher-id}/
    materials/                       # Teaching materials
    assignments/                     # Student assignments

trash/                               # Soft-deleted files
  {original-path}                    # Preserves original directory structure
```
