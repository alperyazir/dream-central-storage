- Initialized project workspace and created feature branch `feature/story-1-1` for Story 1.1 implementation.
- Scaffolded monorepo structure with Turborepo configuration (`package.json`, `turbo.json`, workspace directories).
- Bootstrapped FastAPI application under `apps/api` with configuration management, database session wiring, and health endpoints.
- Added Docker Compose stack (API, PostgreSQL, MinIO, Nginx) and documented local development steps under `docs/development/docker-compose.md`.
- Created CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to install dependencies and execute backend tests.
- Encountered network restrictions preventing `npm install` and `pip install -e apps/api[dev]`; documented for follow-up.
