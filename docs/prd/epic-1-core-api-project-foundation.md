# **Epic 1: Core API & Project Foundation**

**Epic Goal**: This epic lays the groundwork for the entire Dream Central Storage system. It involves setting up the monorepo, initializing the Python/FastAPI backend project, establishing a CI/CD pipeline, and implementing the core API for creating, reading, and updating book metadata. Upon completion, we will have a deployable, secure, and testable API service, forming the foundational layer for all future features.

## **Story 1.1: Project Initialization & CI/CD**
**As a** developer, **I want** a configured monorepo with an initial FastAPI application and a basic CI/CD pipeline, **so that** I can start building and deploying the backend service efficiently.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A monorepo structure is created and initialized with Git.
2.  A new FastAPI application is created within the monorepo at `apps/api`.
3.  A health-check endpoint (e.g., `GET /`) is implemented that returns a success message.
4.  Database configuration for connecting to a local PostgreSQL instance is in place.
5.  A basic CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) is configured to run tests and linting on every push.

## **Story 1.2: Book Metadata Model & Database Migration**
**As an** administrator, **I want** the system to have a defined data structure for book metadata, **so that** book information can be stored and retrieved consistently.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A database migration tool (e.g., Alembic) is integrated into the FastAPI project.
2.  A migration script is created that generates a `books` table in the PostgreSQL database.
3.  The `books` table includes all required metadata fields: `id`, `publisher`, `book_name`, `language`, `category`, `version`, `status`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
4.  A Pydantic model for the `Book` entity is created to ensure data validation within the API.

## **Story 1.3: User Authentication Endpoints**
**As an** administrator, **I want** to securely log in to the system, **so that** I can receive an access token for making authenticated API requests.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A `users` table is created in the database to store admin credentials securely (hashed passwords).
2.  An endpoint (e.g., `POST /auth/login`) is created that accepts admin credentials.
3.  Upon successful authentication, the endpoint returns a JWT access token.
4.  A command-line script is created to securely add the first admin user to the database.

## **Story 1.4: CRUD Endpoints for Book Metadata**
**As an** administrator, **I want** API endpoints to create, read, update, and list book metadata, **so that** I can manage the book catalog programmatically.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  All endpoints in this story are protected and require a valid JWT for access.
2.  `POST /books`: Creates a new book metadata record in the database.
3.  `GET /books`: Returns a list of all book metadata records.
4.  `GET /books/{book_id}`: Retrieves the metadata for a single book.
5.  `PUT /books/{book_id}`: Updates the metadata for an existing book.
