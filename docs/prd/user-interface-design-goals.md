# **User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**

The UX vision for the Dream Central Storage Admin Panel is a clean, efficient, and straightforward web interface. The primary goal is to provide administrators with a powerful tool for managing application builds and book data with minimal friction. The design should prioritize clarity and ease of use over complex aesthetics, enabling users to perform core tasks like uploading, managing, and restoring content quickly and confidently.

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Dashboard-centric:** A central dashboard will serve as the main entry point, providing an at-a-glance overview and access to all key areas.
* **Table/List-based Data Display:** Books and applications will be presented in sortable and filterable tables or lists for easy navigation.
* **Modal-driven Actions:** Actions like editing metadata or confirming deletions will use modals to keep the user within their current context.
* **Direct Manipulation:** Users will interact directly with items, for example, by clicking a "delete" icon on a specific book entry.

## **Core Screens and Views**

* **Login Screen:** A secure page for administrator authentication.
* **Dashboard:** Main landing page showing lists of books and app builds, possibly with filtering by publisher.
* **Book Management View:** A detailed view for managing all books from a specific publisher.
* **App Build Management View:** A view for managing all application builds for each platform (macOS, Linux, Windows).
* **Metadata Edit Modal/Page:** A form for viewing and editing the metadata associated with a book.
* **Trash/Archive View:** A dedicated area to view soft-deleted items and restore them.
  * Surface retention guidance so administrators know items remain in trash for at least seven days before permanent removal.

## **Accessibility: WCAG AA**

* **Assumption:** The interface will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities. This includes considerations for color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

## **Branding**

* **Assumption:** Minimal branding will be applied. The focus will be on a clean, professional, and functional layout rather than a distinct brand identity at this stage.

## **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

* The application will be a responsive web interface, optimized for use on standard desktop and laptop screen sizes.
