> "Please create the `fullstack-architecture.md` document based on the provided PRD. The architecture must adhere to the technical assumptions outlined within, including the use of a monorepo, a Python/FastAPI backend, a React frontend, a PostgreSQL database, and MinIO for storage. The design should provide a clear blueprint for the development agents to implement the stories defined in the epics."
