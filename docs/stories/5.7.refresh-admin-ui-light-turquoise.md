# Story 5.7: Refresh Admin UI with Light Turquoise Palette

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** administrator,
**I want** the admin panel to adopt a modern, light turquoise visual style,
**so that** the interface feels more inviting and easier to use.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A refreshed design system defines primary, secondary, and accent colors centred on a light turquoise palette along with updated typography and spacing tokens.
2. Core screens (login, dashboard, uploads, trash) adopt the new theme, including buttons, tables, modals, and navigation elements.
3. Accessibility checks confirm WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for contrast and focus states with the revised colors.
4. Design documentation (style guide or component library notes) captures the new tokens, usage guidelines, and example screenshots.
5. Visual regression or snapshot tests are updated to match the refreshed styles.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Produce a concise design spec outlining the light turquoise palette, typography scale, and spacing system updates (AC: 1, 4) [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#overall-ux-vision]
- [x] Implement updated theme tokens within the admin panel (e.g., Material UI theme overrides or CSS variables) and roll them out to shared components (AC: 1, 2) [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md#3-tech-stack]
- [x] Apply the refreshed theme to core screens, ensuring tables, modals, and navigation respect the new tokens (AC: 2) [Source: docs/stories/3.3.dashboard-for-listing-books-apps.md#dev-notes]
- [x] Run accessibility validation (automated + manual contrast checks) and document results, addressing any failures (AC: 3) [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#accessibility-wcag-aa]
- [x] Update automated visual/snapshot tests and storybook (if available) to reflect the new look (AC: 5) [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]
- [x] Capture before/after screenshots and update UI documentation or release notes (AC: 4) [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#core-screens-and-views]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Epic 3 delivered the initial MVP styling with minimal branding; the new palette should build upon its component structure without major layout rewrites. [Source: docs/prd/epic-3-admin-panel-mvp.md]
- Story 3.4 details existing modal and upload component styling; use it to ensure refreshed visuals donâ€™t disrupt established UX patterns. [Source: docs/stories/3.4.book-and-app-folder-upload-ui.md#dev-notes]

### Data Models
- No data changes required.

### API Specifications
- No API changes required.

### Component Specifications
- Update design tokens and ensure derivatives (e.g., button variants, alert colors) remain consistent throughout the system. [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#branding]

### File Locations
- Theme updates live under `apps/admin-panel/src/theme` (or equivalent), with component overrides across `apps/admin-panel/src/components`. Asset documentation belongs in `docs/prd` or `docs/development`. [Source: docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#12-unified-project-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Rebaseline snapshot tests and execute accessibility tooling (e.g., axe) across key pages. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]

- Preserve bundle size and performance; avoid introducing heavyweight design libraries beyond existing stack. [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md#3-tech-stack]

### Project Structure Notes
- Coordinate with branding/documentation stakeholders to ensure future iterations can extend the palette without refactoring. [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#branding]

## Testing
- Automated: snapshot/visual regression tests, accessibility tooling.
- Manual: stakeholder review of refreshed screens, manual contrast verification.

### Completion Notes List
- Introduced a full turquoise design system (palette, typography, spacing) documented in `docs/prd/ui-theme-light-turquoise.md` and wired into the MUI theme.
- Restyled navigation, layout chrome, tables, and forms with new CSS variables, gradients, and focus rings while retaining structure.
- Validated contrast ratios with manual tooling, refreshed automated tests, and ensured the bootstrap loader reflects the updated theme.
