# Story 4.4: Integrate Application Monitoring

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to integrate the system with Prometheus/Grafana,
**so that** I can monitor its health and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The FastAPI application exposes a `/metrics` endpoint compatible with Prometheus.
2. The endpoint reports key application metrics including request count, error rate, and request latency.
3. A Grafana dashboard configuration is supplied to visualise core API metrics collected by Prometheus.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Backup automation logs structured events; monitoring can ingest these for further observability once metrics pipeline exists. [Source: docs/stories/4.3.implement-automated-storage-backups.md#qa-results]

### Data Models
- No schema updates anticipated; monitoring focuses on runtime metrics, not persistence. No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### API Specifications
- Ensure `/metrics` endpoint aligns with existing FastAPI router patterns; confirm route placement under monitoring module for maintainability. [Source: docs/architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#11-backend-architecture]

### Component Specifications
- Prometheus and Grafana are the prescribed monitoring stack for this project; expose metrics via the monitoring middleware that renders Prometheus text format. [Source: docs/architecture/19-monitoring-and-observability.md#19-monitoring-and-observability]

### File Locations
- Backend monitoring utilities live under `apps/api/app` (e.g., `app/monitoring`). Docker Compose updates belong in `infrastructure/docker-compose.yml` or monitoring overlays. Dashboard JSON should reside in `infrastructure/monitoring`. [Source: docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#12-unified-project-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Implement unit tests for metrics instrumentation and include manual verification steps for Prometheus + Grafana deployment. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- Deployment remains single VPS with Docker Compose; ensure monitoring containers fit resource constraints and use environment-based configuration for endpoints. [Source: docs/architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#14-deployment-architecture]
- Monitor API latency and errors to support production readiness as described in epic goals. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-advanced-features-production-readiness.md#epic-goal]

### Project Structure Notes
- Keep monitoring assets modular to allow optional deployment (e.g., compose profile). No additional architecture guidance provided.

## Testing
- Automated tests: FastAPI metrics endpoint unit/integration tests verifying Prometheus format and metric increments.
- Manual validation: Deploy Prometheus + Grafana stack, confirm scrape success via Prometheus status page, and verify Grafana dashboard displays real-time metrics.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-03
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- PASS – Metrics middleware captures request totals, errors, and latency aggregates while guarding `/metrics` from double instrumentation, and monitoring assets live under infrastructure overlays (`apps/api/app/monitoring/middleware.py:9`, `infrastructure/docker-compose.yml:1`).

### Acceptance Criteria Validation
- AC1 – FastAPI now exposes `/metrics` wired through monitoring router and compose stack scrapes it (`apps/api/app/main.py:24`, `infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus.yml:1`).
- AC2 – Middleware records method/path/status counters plus latency sums/counts; tests assert exposure format (`apps/api/app/monitoring/middleware.py:52`, `apps/api/tests/test_metrics_endpoint.py:7`).
- AC3 – Grafana dashboard JSON and runbook provide operational guidance alongside compose profile for Prometheus/Grafana (`infrastructure/monitoring/dashboards/dream-central-api.json:1`, `docs/operations/monitoring-runbook.md:1`).

### Test Review
- `pytest` (apps/api/) – 64 tests validate metrics endpoint and regression suite.
- Manual validation documented in runbook includes scraping targets and dashboard import steps (`docs/operations/monitoring-runbook.md:31`).

### NFR Assessment
- Security: PASS – Monitoring services isolated via optional compose profile; Grafana default creds flagged for change (`infrastructure/docker-compose.yml:45`).
- Performance: PASS – Scrape interval 15s; metrics middleware lightweight dictionary aggregation (`infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus.yml:1`, `apps/api/app/monitoring/middleware.py:34`).
- Reliability: PASS – Runbook outlines troubleshooting and validation to ensure scrape health (`docs/operations/monitoring-runbook.md:37`).
- Maintainability: PASS – Monitoring modules isolated; dashboard stored as versioned JSON for updates (`apps/api/app/monitoring/__init__.py:1`).

### Issues & Risks
- None observed.

### Recommendations
- Future: Integrate alerting rules and surface backup success metrics when Prometheus alerts are introduced (`infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus.yml:1`).

### Gate Decision Recommendation
- Recommend **PASS** – Monitoring stack meets requirements with automated coverage and deployment instructions.

### Suggested Status
- Ready for Done
