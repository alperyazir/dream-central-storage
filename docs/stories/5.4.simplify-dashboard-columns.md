# Story 5.4: Simplify Dashboard Columns

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** administrator,
**I want** the dashboard tables to hide raw storage paths,
**so that** I see only actionable information while managing books and app builds.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The "Storage Path" column is removed from both book and app listings in the admin panel.
2. Table layouts reflow cleanly on desktop breakpoints with no truncated headers or overflowing actions after the column removal.
3. Automated tests and snapshots are updated to reflect the new column structure.
4. Product documentation/screenshots no longer reference the storage path column.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Remove the storage path column and associated renderers from book and app table components (AC: 1) [Source: docs/stories/3.3.dashboard-for-listing-books-apps.md#acceptance-criteria]
  - [x] Ensure any tooltip/help text tied to storage paths is adjusted or removed accordingly (AC: 1, 4) [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#key-interaction-paradigms]
- [x] Review layout spacing and responsive behavior after the column removal, adjusting column widths or flex properties as needed (AC: 2) [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#core-screens-and-views]
- [x] Update frontend tests (Vitest/RTL) and snapshot expectations for the table headers and rows (AC: 3) [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]
- [x] Refresh user-facing documentation or onboarding guides with updated screenshots (AC: 4) [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#core-screens-and-views]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 3.3 defined the initial dashboard layout; review its dev notes to understand current column composition. [Source: docs/stories/3.3.dashboard-for-listing-books-apps.md#dev-notes]

### Data Models
- No backend metadata changes are required; the column was purely presentational.

### API Specifications
- API responses still include storage paths; consumers beyond the UI may rely on them, so avoid changing contracts.

### Component Specifications
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography per the existing design tokens. [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#overall-ux-vision]

### File Locations
- Relevant components live in `apps/admin-panel/src/features/books` and `apps/admin-panel/src/features/apps`, with shared table utilities under `apps/admin-panel/src/components`. [Source: docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#12-unified-project-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Update unit tests and integration snapshots for table rendering; ensure new expectations are baselined. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- Preserve accessibility by keeping column headers aligned with table semantics after removal. [Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md#accessibility-wcag-aa]

### Project Structure Notes
- If shared column configuration objects exist, update them centrally to prevent drift between book and app tables. [Source: docs/architecture/13-development-workflow.md#shared-contracts]

## Testing
- Frontend: adjust and run unit + snapshot tests for tables.
- Manual: verify visual layout in primary breakpoints.
