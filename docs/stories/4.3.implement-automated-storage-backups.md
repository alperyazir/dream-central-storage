# Story 4.3: Implement Automated Storage Backups

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** an automated daily backup of the MinIO storage,
**so that** data can be recovered in case of a server failure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A script is created that can sync all MinIO buckets to a secondary, off-site storage location.
2. The script is configured to run automatically on a daily schedule via a cron job on the VPS.
3. The script includes logging to provide a clear record of successful and failed backup attempts.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Capture backup requirements, including bucket scope, destination, and retention expectations (AC: 1) [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-advanced-features-production-readiness.md#story-43-implement-automated-storage-backups]

  - [x] Provide automated verification (unit or integration) for script argument parsing and failure handling, including dry-run coverage (AC: 1, 3) [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]
  - [x] Document manual validation checklist covering cron invocation and sample restore drill (AC: 2, 3) [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-advanced-features-production-readiness.md#story-43-implement-automated-storage-backups]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Restore workflows rely on preserved bucket/prefix structure; backups must keep naming consistent to support future recoveries. [Source: docs/stories/4.2.restore-functionality-from-trash.md#dev-notes]

### Data Models
- No additional schema changes required for file backups; MinIO buckets remain primary storage abstraction. No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### API Specifications
- Backup process interfaces directly with MinIO rather than public REST endpoints. No specific API guidance found in architecture docs.

### Component Specifications
- MinIO operates as the storage component within the deployment; scripts should authenticate using existing MinIO credentials and use the `mc` CLI for mirroring. [Source: docs/architecture/6-components.md#6-components]

### File Locations
- Infrastructure assets live under the monorepo’s `infrastructure/` directory; place backup automation scripts and cron assets there for consistency. [Source: docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#12-unified-project-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Follow existing testing strategy: supply automated tests where feasible and provide manual validation steps for cron execution. [Source: docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]
- Cron drill guidance documented in `docs/operations/minio-backup-runbook.md`. [Source: docs/operations/minio-backup-runbook.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Off-site backups support NFR4’s requirement for secondary storage synchronization; ensure the destination accommodates all MinIO buckets. [Source: docs/prd/requirements.md#non-functional]
- Log results of each run so administrators can audit success/failure, aligning with FR7. [Source: docs/prd/requirements.md#functional]
- Cron-based scheduling must respect the single-VPS deployment architecture. [Source: docs/architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#14-deployment-architecture]

### Project Structure Notes
- Keep backup assets modular to support future monitoring integrations (e.g., metrics in Story 4.4). No additional architecture guidance provided.

## Testing
- `pytest infrastructure/tests/test_backup_minio.py`
- Manual validation: Execute `/usr/local/bin/dream-backup --log-path /tmp/minio-backup.log` with dry-run credentials, review `/tmp/minio-backup.log`, confirm cron entry executes the wrapper once installed.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-03
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- PASS – Backup tooling is isolated under `infrastructure/`, leverages the Mc CLI via a Python wrapper, and logs structured mirror events for auditability (`infrastructure/scripts/backup_minio.py:1`, `infrastructure/scripts/dream-backup.sh:1`).

### Acceptance Criteria Validation
- AC1 – `backup_minio.py` iterates configured buckets, ensures target paths exist, and mirrors source buckets preserving prefix structure (`infrastructure/scripts/backup_minio.py:125`).
- AC2 – Cron definition and wrapper script deliver scheduled execution with documented installation steps (`infrastructure/cron/dream-storage-backup:1`, `docs/operations/minio-backup-runbook.md:19`).
- AC3 – Structured logging and error handling capture mirror outcomes; runbook explains where logs live and how to react (`infrastructure/scripts/backup_minio.py:189`, `docs/operations/minio-backup-runbook.md:29`).

### Test Review
- Unit tests validate command orchestration and failure propagation for the backup script (`infrastructure/tests/test_backup_minio.py:1`).
- Manual validation flow captured in runbook covers dry-run invocation and cron verification (`docs/operations/minio-backup-runbook.md:41`).
- Commands executed: `pytest infrastructure/tests/test_backup_minio.py`.

### NFR Assessment
- Security: PASS – Credentials supplied via env file with instructions to secure permissions (`docs/operations/minio-backup-runbook.md:12`).
- Performance: PASS – Mirrors run nightly; Mc handles incremental syncs to minimise transfer; monitoring recommended for large buckets (`infrastructure/scripts/backup_minio.py:142`).
- Reliability: PASS – Non-zero exits log failures, cron wrapper captures stderr, and runbook details failure handling (`docs/operations/minio-backup-runbook.md:45`).
- Maintainability: PASS – Scripts self-contained, env-driven, and tested; runbook documents operational steps (`infrastructure/scripts/backup_minio.py:40`).

### Issues & Risks
- None observed.

### Recommendations
- Future: Integrate backup success metrics into the upcoming Prometheus monitoring work to surface failures proactively (`infrastructure/scripts/backup_minio.py:188`).

### Gate Decision Recommendation
- Recommend **PASS** – Backup automation meets requirements with clear documentation and coverage.

### Suggested Status
- Ready for Done
