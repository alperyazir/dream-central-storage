# Story 1.2: Book Metadata Model & Database Migration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** administrator,
**I want** the system to have a defined data structure for book metadata,
**so that** book information can be stored and retrieved consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A database migration tool (e.g., Alembic) is integrated into the FastAPI project.
2. A migration script is created that generates a `books` table in the PostgreSQL database.
3. The `books` table includes all required metadata fields: `id`, `publisher`, `book_name`, `language`, `category`, `version`, `status`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
4. A Pydantic model for the `Book` entity is created to ensure data validation within the API.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Initial FastAPI project scaffolding, repository placeholders, and CI integration are complete from Story 1.1, so Alembic should integrate with the existing SQLAlchemy session utilities. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.project-initialization-ci-cd.md#dev-agent-record]

### Data Models
- The shared `Book` interface defines required fields (`id`, `publisher`, `book_name`, `language`, `category`, `version?`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) and status options (`draft`, `published`, `archived`) that the database and schema must mirror. [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#book]
- Because `version` is optional in the shared interface, the database column should allow `NULL` and default to no value until explicitly set. [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#book]

### API Specifications
- Book management will be exposed through RESTful endpoints conforming to the project OpenAPI contract, so schemas must align with documented payload structure. [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#5-api-specification]

### Component Specifications
- No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

### File Locations
- Backend implementation for the API resides in `apps/api`, with deployable apps separated from shared packages per monorepo standards. [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]
- Follow the unified project structure when introducing new modules (e.g., migrations, models, schemas) under the backend application tree. [Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#12-unified-project-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Backend testing relies on Pytest with tests colocated under `apps/api/tests`; new migration and schema coverage should extend that suite. [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- Continue targeting Python 3.11+, FastAPI 0.111+, and PostgreSQL 16 as defined in the stack; Alembic selection must remain compatible with this runtime. [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#3-tech-stack]
- Repository and database access follow the established repository pattern for maintainability. [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]
- Database schema guidance notes the presence of constraints and triggers, so `created_at` and `updated_at` should default to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, with `updated_at` managed via trigger or equivalent database automation. [Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md#9-database-schema]

### Project Structure Notes
- Keep migration artifacts and models within the backend application so monorepo boundaries stay clean between apps and shared packages. [Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#12-unified-project-structure]

### Testing
- Add Pytest modules alongside existing backend tests and ensure they execute through the established CI workflow without custom commands. [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]

GPT-5 Codex (Developer Mode)

### Debug Log References
- `pytest apps/api/tests/test_migrations_books.py apps/api/tests/test_schemas_book.py` (pass)

### Completion Notes List
- Alembic scaffold created under `apps/api/alembic` and configured to reuse project settings.
- Added SQLAlchemy `Book` model with nullable `version`, timestamp defaults, and status enum alignment.
- Authored initial migration plus repository updates and verified via SQLite-backed migration test.
- Introduced Pydantic schemas and unit tests for migration behaviour and schema validation.
- Executed `pytest` (7 total tests) successfully within the sandboxed environment.
- Attempted `alembic upgrade head` against local Docker Postgres but sandbox networking blocked the connection (`Operation not permitted`); instructions provided to rerun outside sandbox.
- Added dialect-aware trigger/function to ensure `updated_at` refreshes on every mutation and extended migration test to validate the behaviour.

## QA Results
- Gate: PASS â€“ Dialect-aware trigger/function now updates `books.updated_at` on every mutation, satisfying the timestamp automation requirement (`apps/api/alembic/versions/20250922_01_create_books_table.py:47`).
- Evidence:
  - PostgreSQL trigger/function sets `updated_at = NOW()` before each update, and the SQLite trigger keeps local regression behaviour consistent (`apps/api/alembic/versions/20250922_01_create_books_table.py:47`).
  - Migration test executes an UPDATE and asserts the timestamp changes, closing the prior coverage gap (`apps/api/tests/test_migrations_books.py:68`).
- Residual Risks:
  - Recommend exercising the migration against the target Postgres instance during deployment readiness to confirm trigger creation succeeds with production extensions enabled.
