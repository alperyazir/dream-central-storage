# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & CI/CD

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a configured monorepo with an initial FastAPI application and a basic CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** I can start building and deploying the backend service efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo structure is created and initialized with Git.
2. A new FastAPI application is created within the monorepo at `apps/api`.
3. A health-check endpoint (e.g., `GET /`) is implemented that returns a success message.
4. Database configuration for connecting to a local PostgreSQL instance is in place.
5. A basic CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) is configured to run tests and linting on every push.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Set up Docker Compose for services alignment (supports AC: 4) [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#14-deployment-architecture]
  - [ ] Define services for FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MinIO, and Nginx reverse proxy to mirror VPS deployment (AC: 4) [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]
  - [ ] Provide developer documentation for running compose stack during local development (AC: 1) [Source: architecture/13-development-workflow.md#13-development-workflow]
- [ ] Implement GitHub Actions CI pipeline (AC: 5) [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#14-deployment-architecture]
  - [ ] Configure workflow to install dependencies, run linting, and execute tests (AC: 5) [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]
  - [ ] Ensure pipeline artifacts and caching align with monorepo layout (AC: 5) [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- No previous stories completed; this is the initial story in the program.

### Data Models
- Future work will use the shared `Book` metadata interface described in the architecture, but no schema changes are required in this story. Confirm the exact shared package location during implementation. [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#4-data-models]

### API Specifications
- Follow RESTful conventions with OpenAPI 3.0 documentation for endpoints such as the health check implemented here. [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#5-api-specification]

### Component Specifications
- No frontend components are touched in this initialization story; React admin panel setup occurs in later epics. [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]

### File Locations
- Place backend code under `apps/api` and shared libraries under `packages/` per monorepo guidance. [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]
- Infrastructure definitions (e.g., Docker Compose) live under `infrastructure/` as part of the unified project structure. [Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#12-unified-project-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Use Pytest for backend unit tests; ensure CI runs the suite. [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- Target Python 3.11+ and FastAPI 0.111+ for the backend service. [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#3-tech-stack]
- Leverage Docker Compose to mirror production VPS deployment during development. [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#14-deployment-architecture]
- Prepare for GitHub Actions as the CI/CD platform. [Source: architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md#14-deployment-architecture]

### Project Structure Notes
- Confirm Turborepo configuration (`turbo.json`, root `package.json`) aligns with the defined apps/packages layout; adjust if Turborepo defaults differ from the prescribed structure. [Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]

### Testing
- Ensure CI job runs `pytest` for backend modules and linting appropriate to the Python stack. [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]
