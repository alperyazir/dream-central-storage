# Story 1.5: API CORS Configuration for Admin Panel Access

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** frontend developer,
**I want** the API to permit cross-origin requests from approved admin panel origins,
**so that** the React client can successfully authenticate without browser CORS errors.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The FastAPI service enables CORS middleware that allows credentials and standard methods (`GET`, `POST`, `OPTIONS`, etc.) for configured origins.
2. Allowed origins are configurable via environment variable(s) with sensible defaults for local development (`http://localhost:5173`).
3. Preflight `OPTIONS` requests to authentication endpoints (e.g., `/auth/login`) succeed without returning 405 errors.
4. Documentation (README or env sample) lists the new configuration knob(s) and default values.
5. Automated tests cover at least one CORS preflight scenario, validating expected headers in the response.

  - [x] Verify disallowed origin returns correct headers/status (AC: 1, 5) [Source: architecture/15-security-and-performance.md#15-security-and-performance]

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Story 3.2 highlighted that the admin panel relies on the API for authentication; without CORS support the React client cannot call `/auth/login` from `localhost:5173`. [Source: docs/stories/3.2.admin-login-page-authentication.md#qa-results]

### Data Models
- No data model changes required.

### API Specifications
- CORS middleware must preserve existing `/auth/login` request/response schema while adding appropriate CORS headers. [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#5-api-specification]

### Component Specifications
- Backend follows FastAPI router architecture with dependencies defined per module. [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#11-backend-architecture]

### File Locations
- Middleware and settings updates belong under `apps/api/app` with configuration managed in `app/core/config.py` and application wiring in `app/main.py`. [Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#12-unified-project-structure]
- Tests reside in `apps/api/tests` following existing Pytest layout. [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]

### Testing Requirements
- Use Pytest with the existing FastAPI test client to exercise CORS preflight logic and header assertions. [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
- Continue using FastAPI and Starlette middleware per tech stack guidance; configuration must remain environment-driven via Pydantic settings. [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#3-tech-stack]
- Ensure security posture remains aligned with project standards for CORS and authentication. [Source: architecture/15-security-and-performance.md#15-security-and-performance]

## Testing
- Add Pytest cases in `apps/api/tests` to validate preflight success and header contents for allowed origins, and failure/absence for disallowed origins. [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#16-testing-strategy]

## QA Results
### QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-28
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- CORS middleware registration is centralized in `app/main.py` and fed by normalized settings, ensuring future origin additions remain config-driven.
- Settings helper cleans string/list inputs for `cors_allowed_origins`, preventing whitespace and supporting comma-separated env values.
- Documentation and sample env values now reference the new configuration knob, aligning ops with implementation.

### Requirements Traceability
- **AC1** – `app/main.py` adds `CORSMiddleware` with credentials + methods/headers allowed.
- **AC2** – `Settings.cors_allowed_origins` with normalization + `.env.example` default `http://localhost:5173`.
- **AC3** – `test_cors.py::test_preflight_succeeds_for_allowed_origin` exercises OPTIONS `/auth/login` successfully.
- **AC4** – README configuration section and `.env.example` listing cover docs update.
- **AC5** – `test_cors.py` includes allowed and disallowed origin assertions.

### Test Architecture Assessment
- Pytest client coverage verifies header values for allowed origins and rejects unknown origins, covering success/failure paths.
- Full `pytest` run executed; no other suites required for this change.

### NFR Validation
- **Security:** PASS – Disallowed origins are rejected with no CORS headers; config remains env-driven.
- **Performance:** PASS – Middleware adds negligible overhead, preflight short-circuits gracefully.
- **Reliability:** PASS – Defaults ensure local admin panel works; normalization avoids malformed lists.
- **Maintainability:** PASS – Single settings property centralizes origin parsing; README documents usage.

### Testability Evaluation
- Controllability achieved via env-based configuration and explicit tests.
- Observability confirmed through header assertions in tests.
- Debuggability aided by concise helper and test coverage.

### Risk Summary
- Residual risk: Low. Only new dependency is env-controlled CORS list; future updates limited to configuration.

### Tests Observed
- `cd apps/api && pytest`

### Gate Recommendation
- **PASS** – Ready to merge and deploy.
