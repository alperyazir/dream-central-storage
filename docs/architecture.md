## 2. High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

The Dream Central Storage system will be a **full-stack application** built withinâ€¦

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice

The initial development environment will be run locally using Docker, perfectly mirroring production.

- **Platform:** Self-hosted on a **VPS** (e.g., DigitalOcean, Hetzner).
- **Key Services:**
  - **MinIO:** For S3-compatible object storage.
  - **PostgreSQL:** For relational metadata storage.
  - **Nginx:** As a reverse proxy to direct traffic to frontend and backend services.

### Repository Structure

We will use a **Monorepo** managed by **Turborepo** to contain all source code.

- **Structure:** Monorepo  
- **Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo  
- **Package Organization:**
  - `apps/`: Deployable applications (`api` for FastAPI backend, `admin` for React frontend).
  - `packages/`: Shared code such as common TypeScript types or UI components.

### Architectural Patterns

- **Scalable Monolith:** Backend API as a single app with modular structure.  
  *Rationale: faster initial development, simpler deployment.*  

- **Component-Based UI:** React frontend as reusable components.  
  *Rationale: maintainable, scalable UI.*  

- **Repository Pattern (Backend):** Database logic abstracted via repository.  
  *Rationale: testability, flexibility.*  

- **API Gateway (via Reverse Proxy):** Nginx acts as API Gateway.  
  *Rationale: SSL termination, CORS, routing.*

## 4. Data Models

### Book  
- **Purpose:** Represents metadata for a single interactive book.  

```ts
// packages/shared/
export interface Book {
  id: number;
  publisher: string;
  book_name: string;
  language: string;
  category: string;
  version?: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'archived';
  created_at: string; // ISO 8601
  updated_at: string; // ISO 8601
}
```

### User  
- **Purpose:** Represents an admin user with credentials.  

```ts
// packages/shared/
export interface User {
  id: number;
  email: string;
  hashed_password: string;
}

export interface SafeUser {
  id: number;
  email: string;
}
```
