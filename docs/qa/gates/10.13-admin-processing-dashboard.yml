  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All endpoints require Bearer auth. Bulk operations require user auth (not API key). No injection vulnerabilities.'
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'N+1 query potential in list_books_with_processing_status (calls queue_service.list_jobs per book). Acceptable for dashboard use case but could be optimized.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proper error handling with try/catch blocks. Graceful degradation when queue fetch fails. Auto-refresh only when jobs active.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation of concerns. Well-typed TypeScript. Follows existing patterns. Good test coverage.'
